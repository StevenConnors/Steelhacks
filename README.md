## MonumentVR

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this web application comes from one of our members. He loves playing the mobile game, Monument Valley, and we thought that it would be interesting if we could play the game in a Virtual Reality setting.

## What it does
The whole point of the game is to bring the user from the start position, to the end position. To do this the user has to go to various places in the field to unlock features of the field.

Because this application is browser based, users can either play through a desktop browser using Oculus Rift, without an Oculus Rift, or through their mobile device using a Google Cardboard.

## How we built it
We built it using a framework called A-Frame, which is built upon the Three.js library. This framework allows us to create the virtual reality world, in HTML and Javacript syntax, and render it on the browser. 

We created the graphics of MonumentVR through an application called MagicaVoxel, which is a 3D version of a pixel graphic editor. Although there was a template similar to our current set up, we had to significantly modify it in order to allow us to include animations and movements in the world.

## Challenges we ran into
Our largest challenge that we faced was the issue of how to create this application. The original game uses the 3rd-person view to its fullest, creating optical illusions which are the focus of the game. However, since we wanted to fully use the capabilities of Virtual Reality, we decided to create the game in a first person manner. As a result, we had to find a different way of representing the optical illusions so that they would make sense.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a browser based virtual reality game that can be run on desktop, Oculus Rift, and in mobile (Google Cardboard). 

## What we learned
- Basic HTML & Javascript
- The usage of the A-Frame framework.
- Setting AWS up

## What's next for MonumentVR
Although we don't think we will pursue this project anymore, we're excited that we now know how to create virtual reality worlds in the browser, and that we can incorporate it into our next projects.
